WebGL-Project
=============

This is the OpenGL project from Silke Rohn und Benedikt Klotz.
The Webgl Demo is named "critical element". You can change 
the state of the element by adding chemical elements to it, 
but caution it could explode! 

=============

To start the demo simply extract the files to a directory of a 
webserver and start the index.html.
